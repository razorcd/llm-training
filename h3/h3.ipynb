Get used to solving problems and reading documentation. This will be a real life skill you need when employed. [ctrl+f] is your friend, use it! It is a universal shortcut and works in all apps/browsers.\\nWhat does the error say? There will often be a description of the error or instructions on what is needed or even how to fix it. I have even seen a link to the solution. Does it reference a specific line of your code?\\nRestart app or server/pc.\\nGoogle it, use ChatGPT, Bing AI etc.\\nIt is going to be rare that you are the first to have the problem, someone out there has posted the fly issue and likely the solution.\\nSearch using: <technology> <problem statement>. Example: pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.\\nThere are often different solutions for the same problem due to variation in environments.\\nCheck the tech’s documentation. Use its search if available or use the browsers search function.\\nTry uninstall (this may remove the bad actor) and reinstall of application or reimplementation of action. Remember to restart the server/pc for reinstalls.\\nSometimes reinstalling fails to resolve the issue but works if you uninstall first.\\nPost your question to Stackoverflow. Read the Stackoverflow guide on posting good questions.\\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask\\nThis will be your real life. Ask an expert in the future (in addition to coworkers).\\nAsk in Slack\\nBefore asking a question,\\nCheck Pins (where the shortcut to the repo and this FAQ is located)\\nUse the slack app’s search function\\nUse the bot @ZoomcampQABot to do the search for you\\ncheck the FAQ (this document), use search [ctrl+f]\\nWhen asking a question, include as much information as possible:\\nWhat are you coding on? What OS?\\nWhat command did you run, which video did you follow? Etc etc\\nWhat error did you get? Does it have a line number to the “offending” code and have you check it for typos?\\nWhat have you tried that did not work? This answer is crucial as without it, helpers would ask you to do the suggestions in the error log first. Or just read this FAQ document.\\nDO NOT use screenshots, especially don’t take pictures from a phone.\\nDO NOT tag instructors, it may discourage others from helping you. Copy and paste errors; if it’s long, just post it in a reply to your thread.\\nUse ``` for formatting your code.\\nUse the same thread for the conversation (that means reply to your own thread).\\nDO NOT create multiple posts to discuss the issue.\\nlearYou may create a new post if the issue reemerges down the road. Describe what has changed in the environment.\\nProvide additional information in the same thread of the steps you have taken for resolution.\\nTake a break and come back later. You will be amazed at how often you figure out the solution after letting your brain rest. Get some fresh air, workout, play a video game, watch a tv show, whatever allows your brain to not think about it for a little while or even until the next day.\\nRemember technology issues in real life sometimes take days or even weeks to resolve.\\nIf somebody helped you with your problem and it's not in the FAQ, please add it there.

Paths in Git Bash follow the Unix-style, so convert the Windows path to a Unix-style path. For example, `C:\\\\Users\\\\[YourUsername]\\\\Anaconda3` becomes `/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3`.\\nAdd Anaconda to your PATH with the command: `export PATH=\"/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/:/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/Scripts/$PATH\"`.\\nTo make this change permanent, add the command to your `.bashrc` file in your home directory.\\nRefresh your environment with the command: `source ~/.bashrc`.\\nFor Windows (without Git Bash):\\nRight-click on \\'This PC\\' or \\'My Computer\\' and select \\'Properties\\'.\\nClick on \\'Advanced system settings\\'.\\nIn the System Properties window, click on \\'Environment Variables\\'.\\nIn the Environment Variables window, select the \\'Path\\' variable in the \\'System variables\\' section and click \\'Edit\\'.\\nIn the Edit Environment Variable window, click \\'New\\' and add the path to your Anaconda installation (typically `C:\\\\Users\\\\[YourUsername]\\\\Anaconda3` and C:\\\\Users\\\\[YourUsername]\\\\Anaconda3\\\\Scripts`).\\nClick \\'OK\\' in all windows to apply the changes.\\nAfter adding Anaconda to the PATH, you should be able to use `pip` from the command line.

Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.\\nThe option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually.
